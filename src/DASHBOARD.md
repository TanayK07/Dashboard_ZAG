## Dashboard Component

The code imports the necessary components and hooks from the Chakra UI library, as well as the `RenderOrders` component and other dependencies.

The `Dashboard` component is a functional component that represents the main dashboard view.

The component initializes state using the `useState` hook. It manages the `orders` state, which is initially set to the data from the JSON file, and the `filterStatus` state, which is initially set to 'All'.

The component also manages the `isCollapsed` state, which controls whether the orders section is collapsed or expanded.

The `filteredOrders` variable filters the orders based on the selected `filterStatus`. If the `filterStatus` is 'All', all orders are displayed; otherwise, only orders with the matching status are shown.

The `filteredStatusOrders` variable further filters the orders with the selected `filterStatus` for displaying in the header.

The `confirmedCount` variable calculates the count of orders with the status "Confirmed" from the `filteredStatusOrders`.

The `handleCollapseToggle` function toggles the `isCollapsed` state between true and false when the collapse/expand icon is clicked.

The JSX code renders the dashboard layout using Chakra UI components. It includes a sidebar component, a section for displaying orders, and a header with a button for adding new orders.

The `RenderOrders` component is conditionally rendered based on the `isCollapsed` state. If `isCollapsed` is true, the orders are not displayed.

Overall, this code represents a simple dashboard that displays orders and allows users to filter and manage them.
